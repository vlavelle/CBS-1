whenever you work with a dataset from cbs, name it data84710 if it’s “84710ENG”, 
or something like that, then it’s easy to see later which graphs use the same dataset etc, and we don't unnecessarily load the same dataset more than once
also much clearer in the server side and UI side, and we should be able to find mistakes easier later

Would recommend first downloading it as :
data <- cbs_get_data(“84710ENG”)
data84710 <- data
And then working with data84710, so that if you mess up when filtering or something you don’t have to keep redownloading it

DO THE SAME FOR THE METADATA
i.e.

metadata84710 <- cbs_get_meta("84710ENG")

Then, when we start making things reactive, if we are using dataset data84710,
I have been labeling the reactive part data_84710
maybe this is confusing, but its working fine for me so far, write below if you think of a better way to distinguish between reactive and non reactive
